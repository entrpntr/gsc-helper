GSC Helper - a DV calculator and routing tool for Pokémon Gold/Silver/Crystal speedruns

GSC Helper was derived from Yellow Helper by Dailyleaf. Per Dailyleaf's request, if you choose
to reuse this code, please credit him, as well as BobChao87 (for his work on a prior DV
calculator that inspired Red Helper and Yellow Helper). Keeping this notice in your source code
repository suffices for this purpose. Also per Dailyleaf's request, please do not ask for
donations for any work that reuses this code.

In addition to Yellow Helper, some GSC Helper code is borrowed from RouteTwo (created by
Dabomstew).
